# AntiderivativeEstimator
Program that estimates antiderivatives utilising Maclaurin series.

# Setup:
Needs [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/) installed and added to PATH.
Once they are set up, run these commands in your command prompt / terminal:

    git clone https://github.com/jedben2/AntiderivativeEstimator.git
    cd AntiderivativeEstimator/
    python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    
To run the program, do:

    python3 main.py
    
in the directory.

# Explaination

So this program plots an approximaton of a function's antiderivative. It does this via a series which stems from the function's Maclaurins series
